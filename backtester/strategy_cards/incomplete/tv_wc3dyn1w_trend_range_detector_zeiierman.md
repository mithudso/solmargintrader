# Trend Range Detector (Zeiierman)

Version: 1.0.0 (2026-11-08). Delta: first source-reconciled card.

> **Spec-only — no strategy implementation or performance result is claimed.**
> This card records a signal or research method. An indicator alone is not an order rule.

## Mechanism and equations

This publication documents the source-specific indicator named above. The
author-defined mechanism and any stated inputs are preserved in the passages below.
A similar component name does not make it equivalent to an existing strategy.
No missing equation or trading threshold has been supplied by inference.

## Documented inputs and source details

> Trend Range Detector (Zeiierman) is a market structure tool that identifies and tracks periods of price compression by forming adaptive range boxes based on volatility and price movement. When prices remain stable within a defined band, the script dynamically draws a range box; when prices break out of that structure, the box highlights the breakout in real-time.

> Volatility Envelope: Based on an ATR(2000) multiplied by a user-defined factor to account for broader market volatility trends.

> Blue Boxes represent areas where price has remained within a defined volatility envelope over a sustained number of bars. These zones reflect stable, low-volatility periods, often associated with consolidation, equilibrium, or market indecision.

> If both conditions are satisfied over the most recent length bars, a range box is drawn to visually anchor the zone.

> Minimum Range Length: Number of candles required for a valid range to form.

I will not accept liability for any loss or damage, including without limitation any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on such information.

These are bounded passages from the author description, not independently verified
formulas, defaults or performance. No complete repository implementation has been established for this source-specific card. Captured descriptions may include formulas and example code snippets.
Recover every missing numerical definition before implementation.

## Existence check

The coverage ledger checked the existing card names, registry, indicator functions and
Compound scorecard before this card was created. Related components do not establish
equivalence to this complete specification. Exact matches reuse their existing entry
in the ledger instead of receiving another card.

Related existing/specification cards: `tv_method_market_structure`.

## Data and availability

Required inputs: ohlcv, synchronized-point-in-time-universe.
The complete point-in-time input set has not been verified in the repository. Do not substitute current snapshots or inferred values for historical inputs.

## Implementation and validation

No runner or registry key is assigned. Before implementation, freeze the numerical
formula, seeds, missing-value policy, warm-up and parameter domains. Where the source
does not disclose an algorithm or default, recover it rather than guessing. Specify
entry, exit, stop, holding horizon, exposure and costs separately from the indicator.
Record which choices come from the publication and which define a new experiment.

Compute with closed bars and trailing data only. Confirm pivots and higher-timeframe
values before use; never backdate a signal to a pivot that needed later bars. Test
prefix invariance, flat/zero inputs, unavailable data and one-bar-delayed execution.
Evaluate chronologically out of sample, deduct transaction and financing costs and compare with
buy-and-hold and simpler component rules. Record all searched configurations.

## Failure modes and caveats

An author description is not source code or independent validation. Visual styling,
retrospective drawing anchors, repainting pivots and fitted full-history models can
produce unavailable historical signals. A rule can be numerically correct and lose
after costs. Venue, session, data and asset differences limit transfer to SOL.

## Measured results

Not measured in this repository. Publication examples, advertised accuracy and
screenshots are not repository backtest results.

## Likelihood of success: low

Basis: a-priori. The mechanism has no confirming out-of-sample result here. This rating
does not promote the source author's claims into evidence of profitability.
