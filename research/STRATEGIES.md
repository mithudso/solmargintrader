## Method note (read first)

The request asked for a `/dr` deep-research pass. Subagent fan-out is unavailable in this
environment, so this is grounded in the **local citation-backed corpus** —
`~/.claude/skills/trading-and-investing/references/`, ~620 KB across 14 references covering
technical analysis, trading styles, algorithmic/quant methods, ML-for-trading pitfalls, crypto
and DeFi venues — plus **first-hand measurement** on real SOL data. That substitution is
deliberate and stated rather than made silently. Literature claims are attributed to their
source; everything else was measured here.

**Scope is bounded deliberately.** "Every known trading strategy" is unbounded — the great
majority of named strategies are parameter permutations of a few dozen mechanisms. This
document covers **42 distinct mechanisms** across ten families (16 measured + 26 spec-only),
treating each family's mechanism once and naming variants inline rather than giving each its
own entry.

### The headline empirical result

Evaluation is **combinatorial purged cross-validation** (8 blocks, k=2, 28 paths per
configuration), now run over **all 25 registered strategies** — the original 16 plus nine
implemented from the spec-only cards. Across 1,287 configurations:

- **PBO is 0.343 / 0.700 / 0.700** (short / medium / long). Calibrated against constructed
  controls in the test suite, **pure noise gives 0.500 and a genuinely ordered signal set gives
  0.000** — so at the daily horizons in-sample rank is *anti*-informative.
- **At the short horizon not one of the 25 has a positive median path Sharpe.** The best,
  `stoch_14_3` at −0.341, still loses.
- Growing the search 16 → 25 raised PBO by **+0.100 (medium) and +0.150 (long)** once the
  coincident block-set change is held fixed — the multiple-testing effect, measured rather than
  cited. Full decomposition in `RANKED_LISTS.md`.
- Best rows now: `hurst_switch` (medium, +0.699, 93% of paths positive), `obv_trend_60` (long,
  +0.774, 81%), `vol_regime` (long, +0.696, 80%). All three were spec-only or untested before.
- The best figure anywhere — `all(dual_momentum+vol_regime)`, long, median Sharpe **+1.345** on
  **+75.1%** — sits atop a 295-configuration search with PBO 0.650, so it is precisely the row not
  to trust.

Under the earlier single split: 907 configurations, 557 rankable, **70 (13%) with a positive
out-of-sample Sharpe and 45 (8%) that made money**, with in-sample rank *inverted* against
out-of-sample at the medium horizon (Spearman **−0.453**). The cause is stark: the **highest close
in the entire series (\$261.99) is bar 1311 — the final in-sample bar**, so the split separates
the bull market from the bear leg to within a single bar. Full tables and the method contrast in
`RANKED_LISTS.md`.

**Consequence for reading this document:** each entry's `Measured` block quotes single-split
figures, which are evidence about *one regime transition*. Prefer the CPCV distribution in
`RANKED_LISTS.md` List 1 when deciding anything.

### Horizon definitions

| Horizon | Bars | Signal scale | Typical hold | Data |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Short** | 1h | fast (e.g. 12/48) | hours to ~3 days | `data/SOL_1h.csv`, 8,823 bars, 2025-08-01→2026-08-04, **2 disclosed gaps (largest 6h)** |
| **Medium** | 1d | medium (20/50) | ~1–8 weeks | `data/SOL_1d.csv`, 1,875 bars, 2021-06-17→2026-08-04, clean |
| **Long** | 1d | slow (50/200) | ~3–12 months | same daily file, slow parameters |

### Universal backtest requirements

These apply to every entry below and are enforced by the harness (`backtester/`), not left to
the strategy author:

- **Signal at bar *t* reads only data ≤ *t*; the fill happens at bar *t+1*'s open.** Enforced
  structurally: strategies receive a `BarWindow` whose accessors return `arr[:i+1]`, so there
  is no unguarded path to future data. A deliberately-cheating strategy is in the test suite
  and must raise.
- **Rolling statistics use trailing windows only.** Never full-sample normalisation — the most
  common form of look-ahead (Type 1 in the local corpus's four-mechanism taxonomy).
- **Costs on the fill:** 6bps taker fee + 2bps slippage on notional, at the executed price.
- **Warm-up produces no trades.** The first tradeable bar is the first at which every indicator
  is fully defined.
- **70/30 walk-forward**, with the out-of-sample slice starting `warmup` bars early so
  indicators warm from trailing in-sample bars (reading earlier history is not look-ahead;
  starting cold would discard real out-of-sample data).
- **Evidence floor:** fewer than 10 out-of-sample trades ⇒ listed, never ranked.

### Data available vs not

**Available:** OHLCV at 1h and 1d for SOL-USD (Coinbase, keyless). **Not available, so any
mechanism needing it is `SPEC-ONLY` with the gap named:** order-book/L2 depth, trade prints,
funding-rate or borrow-rate history, on-chain flows (DEX volume, active addresses, staking),
a cross-sectional peer universe, options-implied volatility, social sentiment.

# TIER 1 — MEASURED (16 mechanisms)

Implemented in `backtester/core/strategies/`, registered, executed. Real output attached.
Symbols: `C` = close series, `H`/`L` = high/low, `V` = volume, `n` = window length,
`c_t` = close at bar *t*.

---

## 1. Buy & Hold — `baseline` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Fully invested from the first tradeable bar, forever.
**Looks for.** Nothing. It is the null hypothesis every other row must beat.

**Equation.**
```
target_exposure_t = 1.0            for all t
```

**Data.** Close only. Any interval. 2 bars minimum. **Available.**
**Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** 0 bars.

**Works when.** The asset appreciates over the holding period. Structurally unbeatable on
return (though not on drawdown) in a monotonic bull market.
**Fails when.** Any sustained drawdown — it has no exit. Measured max drawdown on full-sample
SOL daily: **−96.27%**.

**Backtest notes.** This is the harness's known-answer test: with zero costs and `fill_delay=0`,
total return must equal `last_close/first_close − 1` exactly. If that identity breaks, the
accounting is wrong and no other row in this document means anything.
**Pairs with.** Nothing — it is the baseline. Any strategy that cannot beat it is a
cost-generating machine.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/buy_and_hold.py`.
**Measured.** Full-sample daily: **+87.61%**, Sharpe 0.617, maxDD −96.27%, 1 trade.
Walk-forward: **IS +565.2% (Sharpe 1.030) → OOS −70.8% (Sharpe −0.651)**.

---

## 2. Moving-Average Crossover — `trend` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Long while a fast simple moving average sits above a slow one.
**Looks for.** Persistent directional drift — the premise that trends continue.

**Equation.**
```
SMA(n)_t = (1/n) * sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_{t-k}
target_t = 1  if SMA(f)_t > SMA(s)_t   else 0        (f < s)
```

**Data.** Close only. 1h or 1d. Minimum `s` bars. **Available.**
**Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `s` bars (50 medium / 200 long).

**Works when.** Trends persist longer than the slow window. Best in low-noise, high-autocorrelation regimes.
**Fails when.** Range-bound chop — every oscillation produces a whipsaw pair of fills. Cost
scales with crossover frequency, so the fast/slow ratio is a cost decision as much as a signal one.
It is also structurally **late**: confirmation requires the averages to already have crossed.

**Backtest notes.** Whipsaw sensitivity means results are highly parameter-dependent; report the
parameter scale, not just "MA crossover". The `--rebalance-threshold` deadband matters here.
**Pairs with.** Volume confirmation (`obv_trend`) to filter unparticipated drifts; a
regime filter to suppress counter-trend entries; breakout for earlier entry.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/ma_crossover.py`.
**Measured.** **Best short-horizon single: OOS Sharpe +0.488** (IS −2.490), +3.4% on 29 trades.
Medium (20/50): IS +735.6% → **OOS −52.3%**, 7 OOS trades (below evidence floor).

---

## 3. MACD — `trend` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Momentum of the gap between two EMAs, against its own EMA.
**Looks for.** Acceleration in trend, earlier than a raw MA cross.

**Equation.**
```
EMA(s)_t   = a*c_t + (1-a)*EMA(s)_{t-1},   a = 2/(s+1)
MACD_t     = EMA(fast)_t - EMA(slow)_t
Signal_t   = EMA(sig) applied to the MACD series
Hist_t     = MACD_t - Signal_t
target_t   = 1 if MACD_t > Signal_t else 0
```

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** EMA recursion; the signal line is an EMA *of the
MACD line*, so a short history of MACD values is needed (see `indicators.ema_series`).
**Warm-up.** `slow + 3*sig` bars.

**Works when.** Directional moves with steady acceleration.
**Fails when.** Choppy conditions produce constant sign flips. **This is the worst measured row
in the entire sweep at the short horizon** — `macd_6_13_5` scored **OOS Sharpe −4.621** across
205 trades, which is what fast-parameter whipsaw plus 8bps round-trip cost looks like.

**Backtest notes.** Naïvely recomputing the MACD history each bar is O(signal·cap · slow·cap) and
dominated total sweep runtime; the single-pass `ema_series` reduces it to O(cap·slow + count).
Worth knowing if you extend this.
**Pairs with.** An oscillator brake (`stochastic`) to stop it adding into exhausted moves —
measured as one of only eight positive medium-horizon pairs.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::MacdCross`.
**Measured.** Medium (12/26/9): **IS +1,356.5% (Sharpe 1.347) → OOS −52.8% (Sharpe −0.720)**,
21 OOS trades. One of the starkest decay rows in the sweep.

---

## 4. Time-Series Momentum — `momentum` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Long when the trailing *n*-bar return is positive.
**Looks for.** The sign of past return predicting the next period — the Moskowitz/Ooi/Pedersen
time-series form, distinct from cross-sectional momentum (which needs a peer universe).

**Equation.**
```
ROC(n)_t = c_t / c_{t-n} - 1
target_t = 1 if ROC(n)_t > threshold  else 0        (threshold default 0)
```

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `n+1` bars.

**Works when.** Momentum is the most-documented anomaly family (Jegadeesh & Titman 1993,
12-month formation / 1-month holding in equities).
**Fails when.** **Momentum crashes** — the corpus documents these as the family's defining risk:
sharp reversals that hit hardest exactly when the signal is most crowded. A single-asset version
has no cross-sectional diversification to soften that.

**Backtest notes.** Highly sensitive to the formation window; 24 bars hourly and 60/200 daily
behave like different strategies. Do not tune the window on the same data you report.
**Pairs with.** A breakout for entry timing; an oscillator to avoid adding at exhaustion.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::TsMomentum`.
**Measured.** Long (200): **IS +506.2% (Sharpe 1.098) → OOS −77.2% (Sharpe −1.976)** — the
worst rankable long-horizon row. Medium (60): IS +392.8% → OOS −51.1%.

---

## 5. Slow-MA Regime Filter — `regime-filter` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Fully long above a slow moving average, flat below it.
**Looks for.** A one-line answer to "is this a bull or bear regime".

**Equation.**
```
target_t = 1 if c_t > SMA(n)_t  else 0              (n = 100 or 200)
```

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `n` bars.

**Works when.** Regimes are persistent. Its value is less in returns than in *avoiding* the
worst drawdowns — the most-cited overlay for that purpose.
**Fails when.** Price oscillates around the average, producing repeated entries and exits at
the worst possible points. Also late by construction at regime turns.

**Backtest notes.** This is the strategy every more elaborate signal should be measured
against: if an eight-parameter system cannot beat "price above its 200-day average", the extra
parameters are not earning their keep.
**Pairs with.** **This is the single most valuable partner in the whole set.** Mean-reversion's
fatal mode is buying dips inside a downtrend, and the regime filter is the only component here
that answers "is there a downtrend". Measured as the top short-horizon pair and top triple.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::Sma200Regime`.
**Measured.** Standalone medium (100): IS +34.8% → **OOS −35.8%**, 13 OOS trades.
**As a partner** it is transformative: `all(sma_regime+bb_reversion)` reached **OOS Sharpe
+2.572** (short) versus +0.086 for `bb_reversion` alone. The `zscore` twin of that pair scored
identically and is no longer built — the two measure 0.96–1.00 correlated and now share one
redundancy class.

---

## 6. Donchian Channel Breakout — `breakout` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Long on a new *n*-bar high; flat on an *m*-bar low. The Turtle mechanism.
**Looks for.** Range expansion — the start of a new trend leg.

**Equation.**
```
Upper_t = max(H_{t-n} .. H_{t-1})       # EXCLUDES the current bar
Lower_t = min(L_{t-m} .. L_{t-1})
enter if c_t > Upper_t ;  exit if c_t < Lower_t
```

**Data.** High, Low, Close. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `max(n,m)+1` bars.

**Works when.** Volatility expands out of contraction, and the trend that follows runs far
enough to pay for the false starts.
**Fails when.** False breakouts dominate. The Turtles' documented win rate was **30–35%** — the
profile depends entirely on a few large winners, so **missing a handful of big moves per year
ruins the year**. That makes short backtest windows especially unreliable for this family.

**Backtest notes.** The channel **must exclude the current bar** — including the current high
makes the comparison nearly always false and silently guts the strategy. Corpus-documented
false-breakout filters worth testing: require two consecutive closes beyond the level; require
the breakout candle body to exceed 70% of its range; require above-average volume.
**Pairs with.** Volume (a genuine breakout shows participation); a volatility-squeeze filter;
a reversion rule for the exit that a pure breakout rule handles poorly.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/breakout.py`.
**Measured.** Full-sample medium: +620.7%, Sharpe 0.935. Walk-forward: **IS +860.2%
(Sharpe 1.265) → OOS −7.5%**, only 7 OOS trades — **below the evidence floor**, which is
exactly the low-trade-count problem the Turtle profile predicts.
`any(breakout+zscore)` was the best measured medium pair at **+0.584** out-of-sample on +30.8%, but it
is no longer built: `zscore` and `bb_reversion` share a redundancy class and only the
representative combination survives. Its surviving sibling `any(breakout+bb_reversion)` scores
**+0.174 on −11.8%** — positive Sharpe, negative money — so this pairing does not carry over.

---

## 7. Bollinger Band Breakout — `breakout` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Long a close above the upper band; optional squeeze pre-filter.
**Looks for.** Statistically unusual strength, optionally after a volatility contraction.

**Equation.**
```
mid_t   = SMA(n)_t
sd_t    = population stdev of last n closes (ddof=0)
upper_t = mid_t + k*sd_t ;  lower_t = mid_t - k*sd_t
bandwidth_t = (upper_t - lower_t) / mid_t                  # the squeeze measure
enter if c_t > upper_t  [and bandwidth_t <= quantile(bandwidth history, q)]
exit  if c_t < mid_t
```

**Data.** Close (High/Low not required). **Available.** **Deps.** None.
**Warm-up.** `n + squeeze_lookback` bars.

**Works when.** Expansion follows contraction — the squeeze gate is the mechanism that tries to
select for that.
**Fails when.** Volatility is already elevated, so the band is wide and a breach means little.
Also vulnerable to gaps: a gap compresses close-to-close stdev while *actual* risk rises, which
is precisely the failure Keltner's ATR basis avoids.

**Backtest notes.** Bollinger specified the **population** stdev (ddof=0); charting packages
follow that, so a ddof=1 implementation will not match published values.
**Pairs with.** The squeeze filter (built in, `squeeze_lookback`, **not swept** — off by
default); volume confirmation; a trend filter for direction.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::BollingerBreakout`.
**Measured.** Medium: **IS +2,843.6% (Sharpe 1.837) → OOS −34.9% (Sharpe −0.841)**.
**The largest in-sample number in the entire sweep, and it lost money out-of-sample.** If you
read one row in this document as a warning about full-sample leaderboards, read this one.

---

## 8. Keltner Channel Breakout — `breakout` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Breakout of an ATR-width channel around an EMA.
**Looks for.** Same as Bollinger breakout, but with a volatility measure that sees gaps.

**Equation.**
```
TR_t  = max(H_t - L_t, |H_t - c_{t-1}|, |L_t - c_{t-1}|)
ATR_t = Wilder smoothing of TR with period p:  ATR_t = (ATR_{t-1}*(p-1) + TR_t)/p
enter if c_t > EMA(s)_t + m*ATR_t ;  exit if c_t < EMA(s)_t
```

**Data.** High, Low, Close. **Available.** **Deps.** EMA + Wilder ATR. **Warm-up.** `3*max(s,p)+1`.

**Works when.** Trending markets with expanding true range.
**Fails when.** Same chop problem as any breakout. Its advantage over Bollinger is specifically
**gap handling** — true range includes the gap, close-to-close stdev does not.

**Backtest notes.** ATR is also the corpus-documented sizing and stop unit: stops at
**1.5–2 ATR**, position sized so 1 ATR of adverse move equals ~1% of account. That risk-overlay
use is arguably more valuable than the entry signal, and is **not** tested here.
**Pairs with.** Trend confirmation; volume.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::KeltnerBreakout`.
**Measured.** Medium: IS +880.7% (Sharpe 1.391) → **OOS −26.4%**, 6 OOS trades (below floor).
Short: **OOS Sharpe −1.954** on 13 trades despite positive IS.

---

## 9. RSI Mean-Reversion — `oscillator-reversion` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Buy when Wilder's RSI is oversold; exit when it recovers past a midline.
**Looks for.** Short-term exhaustion of selling pressure.

**Equation.**
```
gain_t, loss_t   = max(dC_t,0), max(-dC_t,0)
avgGain, avgLoss = Wilder smoothing with period p
RS   = avgGain / avgLoss
RSI  = 100 - 100/(1 + RS)
enter if RSI < oversold ;  exit if RSI > exit_level        (stateful hold between)
```

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** Wilder smoothing. **Warm-up.** `p+1` bars.

**Works when.** Range-bound, mean-reverting conditions.
**Fails when.** **In a strong trend RSI stays overbought or oversold for weeks — the reading
becomes a trend-continuation indicator, not a reversal signal.** The corpus is explicit that
mean-reversion families show attractive 60–80% win rates that conceal rare catastrophic losses:
*"picking up nickels in front of a steamroller."*

**Backtest notes.** Judge on the tail, not the win rate. A 75%-win-rate equity curve with one
−60% trade is not a good strategy, and average-based metrics will hide it. Report max drawdown
and the worst single trade.
**Pairs with.** A regime filter (mandatory in my view — it patches the exact failure mode);
volume to distinguish accumulation from distribution.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/rsi.py`.
**Measured.** Medium: IS −9.6% → OOS −21.9%, only 4 OOS trades (below floor). Short (period 7):
**OOS Sharpe −0.527**. `all(sma_regime+rsi)` reached **OOS +1.456** — the filter did the work.

---

## 10. Stochastic Oscillator with Turn-Up Confirmation — `oscillator-reversion` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Long when %K is oversold **and** already above %D (turning up).
**Looks for.** Position within the recent range, plus evidence the turn has begun.

**Equation.**
```
%K_t = 100 * (c_t - min(L_{t-k+1..t})) / (max(H_{t-k+1..t}) - min(L_{t-k+1..t}))
%D_t = SMA(d) of %K
enter if %K < oversold AND %K > %D ;  exit if %K > exit_level
```

**Data.** High, Low, Close. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `k+d+1` bars.

**Works when.** Ranging markets. The `%K > %D` condition is the meaningful addition — buying
oversold *alone* is how you get run over in a downtrend.
**Fails when.** Sustained trends, same as RSI. Whipsaws on the %K/%D cross in noisy data.

**Backtest notes.** Guard the degenerate case: when the *k*-bar range is zero, %K is undefined;
this implementation returns the neutral 50 rather than dividing by ~0.
**Pairs with.** Momentum, as a brake (`all(macd+stochastic)` was measured positive);
z-score, as a second independent "stretched" statement.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::StochasticOversold`.
**Measured.** Medium: **OOS Sharpe +0.024** (IS +0.153), 11 OOS trades — one of only three
positive medium-horizon singles, and barely distinguishable from zero.

---

## 11. Bollinger Mean-Reversion — `mean-reversion` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Buy a close below the lower band; exit on reversion to the mid.
**Looks for.** Statistically extreme downside deviation.

**Equation.**
```
enter if c_t < mid_t - k*sd_t ;  exit if c_t > mid_t
```

> **Defect to know about.** This is **the same inequality** as the z-score entry below,
> differing only in the stdev convention: `sd(ddof=0)` here vs `sd(ddof=1)` there, a factor
> `sqrt(n/(n-1)) ≈ 1.026` at n=20. The exits are exactly equivalent (`c > mid` ⟺ `z > 0`).
> **These are one mechanism at two thresholds, not two signals** — and because both are in the
> sweep, several "cross-family" pairs and two identical `+2.555` triples are double-counting it.
> Verified from source, not assumed. See `RANKED_LISTS.md` List 3.

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `n` bars.

**Works when.** Range-bound regimes with a stable mean.
**Fails when.** **The mean itself shifts.** The corpus names regime change as the primary
killer: shorting overbought in a secular bull, or buying oversold in a secular bear, compounds
losses. Measured full-sample medium: **−65.64%**.

**Backtest notes.** Bound the hold. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck **half-life** gives the natural cap:
exit at 2–3× half-life regardless of signal; a half-life over 30 days means the series is not
mean-reverting in any tradeable sense. **This implementation has no such cap** — a real gap.
**Pairs with.** Regime filter (essential); volume.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::BollingerReversion`.
**Measured.** Medium: IS −63.9% → **OOS +0.193 Sharpe** (−4.8% return), 10 OOS trades.
`all(sma_regime+bb_reversion)`: **OOS Sharpe +2.572** (short).

---

## 12. Z-Score Mean-Reversion — `mean-reversion` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Buy when price is *z* sample-standard-deviations below its trailing mean.
**Looks for.** Normalised distance from fair value — the same construction used for
cointegration spreads, applied to raw price.

**Equation.**
```
z_t = (c_t - mean(c_{t-n+1..t})) / stdev_sample(c_{t-n+1..t})     # ddof=1
enter if z_t <= entry_z (-2.0) ;  exit if z_t >= exit_z (0.0)
```

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `n` bars.

**Works when.** Stationary or range-bound series. **Raw price is not stationary**, which is the
central theoretical weakness — the corpus applies this to a *cointegrated spread*, where
stationarity is tested, not to a single price. This entry is the degenerate single-asset case.
**Fails when.** Trending markets — z-score simply keeps making new lows.

**Backtest notes.** Zero-dispersion windows must return 0, not divide by ~0 and emit a huge
spurious score. Properly, test the series for stationarity (ADF) before trusting this at all.
**Pairs with.** Regime filter (measured best-in-class); breakout for the exit
(`any(breakout+zscore)` was the top medium pair).

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::ZScoreReversion`.
**Measured.** **Top-ranked medium single: OOS Sharpe +0.699, OOS return +41.3%** (IS −64.8%),
10 OOS trades — exactly at the evidence floor, so read as "not yet disconfirmed", not "works".
Short: **OOS +0.441**, 48 trades.

---

## 13. Rolling VWAP Reversion — `mean-reversion` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Buy a discount to volume-weighted average price; exit on reversion.
**Looks for.** Deviation from the price where volume actually transacted.

**Equation.**
```
TP_t   = (H_t + L_t + c_t)/3                          # typical price
VWAP_t = sum(TP_i * V_i, i in window) / sum(V_i, i in window)
enter if c_t < VWAP_t * (1 - discount) ;  exit if c_t >= VWAP_t
```

**Data.** High, Low, Close, **Volume**. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `n` bars.

**Works when.** Intraday/short-horizon reversion toward a volume-weighted anchor.
**Fails when.** Trending markets. Note this is **rolling**, not session-anchored — crypto has no
session open, so it is a fair-value-deviation signal rather than the execution benchmark VWAP
normally serves as. That is a meaningful reinterpretation, not a detail.

**Backtest notes.** A zero-volume window must fall back to an unweighted mean rather than
dividing by zero. Exchange-reported crypto volume is unreliable across venues; single-venue
volume (as here) is at least internally consistent.
**Pairs with.** OBV, to distinguish a discount being accumulated from one being distributed
(`all(vwap_reversion+obv_trend)` measured **OOS +0.186** long).

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::VwapReversion`.
**Measured.** Medium: **OOS −53.9%** (Sharpe −0.532), 23 OOS trades. Short: **OOS Sharpe −1.516**.
Consistently among the worst measured rows.

## 14. On-Balance Volume Trend — `volume-flow` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Long while cumulative signed volume is above its own moving average.
**Looks for.** Accumulation vs distribution — whether volume is arriving on up-bars or down-bars.

**Equation.**
```
OBV_t = OBV_{t-1} + sign(c_t - c_{t-1}) * V_t
target_t = 1 if OBV_t > SMA(n) of OBV  else 0
```

**Data.** Close + **Volume**. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `n+2` bars.

**Works when.** Volume genuinely leads price. **Price-blind by construction**, which is exactly
what makes it a good *partner* — it sees something no price-based signal can.
**Fails when.** Volume data is unreliable or venue-fragmented (a real crypto problem). OBV is
also a running cumulative sum, so it is **path-dependent and level-arbitrary** — only its slope
relative to its own average carries information.

**Backtest notes.** Because OBV is cumulative from an arbitrary origin, its absolute level is
meaningless and any comparison must be to its own history. Splitting the series (as walk-forward
does) restarts the accumulation — a subtlety worth being aware of when comparing legs.
**Pairs with.** Any price-based trend or breakout signal. This is its highest and best use.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::ObvTrend`.
**Measured.** Medium: **IS +1,932.1% (Sharpe 1.494) → OOS −69.2% (Sharpe −1.383)**.
Long: IS +982.7% → OOS −24.0%, and `any(rsi+obv_trend)` was the **best long-horizon pair
(OOS +0.226)** — though at −8.8% return, meaning low well-behaved exposure, not profit.

## 15. Volatility-Targeted Trend — `risk-overlay` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Trend entry, sized inversely to realised volatility. Continuous exposure.
**Looks for.** Constant *risk* rather than constant *notional*.

**Equation.**
```
sigma_t = stdev(log returns over n bars) * sqrt(periods_per_year)
target_t = min(1, target_vol / sigma_t)   if c_t > SMA(trend)_t   else 0
```

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `max(trend,vol)+1` bars.

**Works when.** Volatility is persistent (it is, in crypto — volatility clusters). Changes the
*shape* of the equity curve rather than the direction of the bet.
**Fails when.** Volatility spikes and price rises together — it de-risks into strength. Also
reacts with a lag equal to the vol window.

**Backtest notes.** **This should be tested as a wrapper around other signals, not as a
standalone strategy — and that is exactly what was not done here.** It is the only candidate in
the set that is orthogonal to direction *by construction* rather than by assumption, so the
untested wrapper configuration is the most obvious gap in this sweep.
**Pairs with.** Everything, multiplicatively. See `RANKED_LISTS.md` List 2 #8.

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::VolTargetTrend`.
**Measured.** Medium: IS +15.7% → **OOS −31.1%**, 73 OOS trades. Short: OOS −0.519, numerically
near-identical to `sma_regime_168` — because when `sigma < target_vol` the cap binds at 1.0 and
it degenerates into the plain regime filter.

---

## 16. Long-Only Grid — `mean-reversion` · MEASURED

**What it is.** Staircase accumulation as price falls below a rolling anchor.
**Looks for.** Range-bound oscillation to harvest.

**Equation.**
```
anchor_t   = SMA(n)_t
drawdown_t = 1 - c_t/anchor_t
rungs_t    = min(floor(drawdown_t / step) + 1, levels)     if drawdown_t > 0 else 0
target_t   = rungs_t / levels
```

**Data.** Close only. **Available.** **Deps.** None. **Warm-up.** `n` bars.

**Works when.** Genuine ranges. Heavily used in crypto because it feels good in a chop.
**Fails when.** **A sustained downtrend — it is short volatility and long the range assumption,
so it reaches maximum exposure exactly when it is most wrong.** This is the most instructive
failure mode in the set: the strategy's own mechanism converts a trend into a maximum-size
losing position.

**Backtest notes.** Grid results are dominated by whether the test window contained a range or a
trend, so a single-window backtest of a grid is close to meaningless. Also generates enormous
trade counts (measured **694 short / 143 long**), making it unusually cost-sensitive.
**Pairs with.** A regime filter, which vetoes precisely the condition that ruins it. **This
pairing was not swept** and is the highest-value untested pair in List 2 (#10).

**Implementation.** `core/strategies/signals.py::GridLong`.
**Measured.** Medium: **OOS −38.9%** (Sharpe −0.590), 100 OOS trades. Short: **OOS Sharpe −1.510**
across 694 trades. Long: OOS −26.5%, 143 trades.

# TIER 2 — SPEC-ONLY (26 mechanisms, numbered 17–42)

**Not implemented and not run. No performance figures — none are given below, deliberately.**
Each entry names the equation, what it needs, and the specific data gap that prevented
measurement. Ordered by family.

## Momentum & trend

**17. Cross-sectional momentum.** Rank a universe by trailing return, hold the top decile.
`R_i = c_i,t/c_i,t-n - 1`; long top-k by rank. The most-documented anomaly family (Jegadeesh &
Titman 1993: 3–12 month formation, 1-month hold). **Gap: no peer universe fetched.** Would also
require survivorship-free constituent history — the corpus estimates survivorship bias inflates
long-only equity backtest returns by **1.5–2.0% annually**.

**18. Dual-momentum / 12-1.** Trailing 12-period return excluding the most recent period, to
skip the short-term reversal effect. **Gap: implementable now** — needs code, not data.

**19. Moving-average ribbon / triple-MA.** Multiple MAs; exposure scales with the fraction in
correct order. Variant of #2, low marginal information.

**20. ADX-filtered trend.** Use Wilder's ADX (`DI+`/`DI-` from directional movement) to gate a
trend signal on trend *strength*. `ADX > 25` conventionally means trending.
**Gap: implementable now.**

**21. Ichimoku cloud.** Multi-component (Tenkan/Kijun/Senkou) trend-and-support system.
Mechanically a bundle of MA crossovers plus a displaced channel; the displacement is a
look-ahead trap if implemented carelessly — the "future cloud" is plotted forward and must
never be read as a current signal.

## Mean-reversion & statistical

**22. Pairs trading / cointegration vs ETH or BTC.** The rigorous version of #12.
Engle-Granger two-step: regress `X = beta*Y + eps`, ADF-test the residual for stationarity; if
`p < 0.05` a cointegrating relation exists. `Spread = X - beta*Y`, trade its z-score: enter
±2.0, exit toward 0, stop ±3.0. Johansen is preferred for 3+ assets (order-invariant).
Practitioner heuristic: require cointegration across 3-, 6-, and 12-month rolling windows.
**Gap: no peer price series.** Primary risk is convergence failure — the relation breaks and the
spread keeps diverging.

**23. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck half-life sizing.** Fit `dX = theta*(mu - X)dt + sigma*dW`;
`half_life = ln(2)/theta`. Cap holds at 2–3× half-life. **Gap: implementable now** — and it is
the missing piece in #11/#12 (neither has a hold cap).

**24. Kalman-filtered dynamic hedge ratio.** Let `beta` evolve as a state variable rather than
fixing it per window. Addresses the corpus-noted instability of static hedge ratios.
**Gap: no peer series.**

**25. Variance-ratio / Hurst exponent regime test.** `H < 0.5` mean-reverting, `H > 0.5`
trending. A *meta*-signal that selects which family to run. **Gap: implementable now — and
this is the highest-value unimplemented item in this tier**, because the entire measured sweep
shows trend and reversion inverting between regimes.

**26. Volatility-regime HMM.** Two-or-three-state hidden Markov model on realised volatility,
switching the active strategy family. **Gap: implementable now.**

## Volatility & options

**27. Implied-vs-realised vol spread.** Harvest the variance risk premium when
`IV - RV` is historically wide. **Gap: no options surface for SOL.**

**28. ATR-normalised position sizing.** Size so 1 ATR of adverse move equals a fixed % of
equity; stops at 1.5–2 ATR. **Gap: implementable now** — a risk overlay, arguably higher value
than most entry signals here, and untested.

**29. GARCH(1,1) volatility forecast.** `sigma2_t = omega + alpha*eps2_{t-1} + beta*sigma2_{t-1}`.
Feeds vol-targeting with a forecast instead of a trailing estimate. **Gap: implementable now.**

**30. Volatility-of-volatility / vol-term-structure.** Requires an options surface. **Gap: no data.**

## Crypto-native / on-chain

**31. Perp funding-rate extremes.** On most venues funding is a signed transfer whose extremes
mark crowded positioning. **On Jupiter specifically there is no funding rate — there is a
borrow fee**, `hourlyBorrowRate = max_rate * utilization`, charged on notional to **both** sides
and floor-bounded at zero. So the tradeable signal there is **utilization**, not funding sign.
**Gap: no borrow-rate/utilization history.** Highest-ranked spec-only signal.

**32. Open-interest divergence.** OI rising while price is flat marks leverage build-up and
liquidation risk. **Gap: no OI history.**

**33. Liquidation-cascade proximity.** Estimate clustered liquidation levels from OI and
leverage distribution; fade or follow the cascade. **Gap: no OI or position data.**

**34. Exchange net-flow / stablecoin flow.** Stablecoins moving onto exchanges as a proxy for
incoming buying power. **Gap: no on-chain data.**

**35. Staking-ratio / validator flow.** SOL-specific float dynamics — a rising staked fraction
reduces liquid supply. **Gap: no on-chain data.**

**36. DEX-vs-CEX price dislocation.** Cross-venue basis as both a signal and an arbitrage.
**Gap: no DEX quote history.** Would additionally need MEV-aware execution modelling (private
RPC or intent protocols) to be realistic.

**37. JLP-vs-SOL relative value.** JLP is ~68% crypto and realises roughly **0.42–0.53× SOL's
short-horizon volatility** (corpus, hourly percentiles). Trading the ratio is a
volatility-dampened SOL expression. **Gap: no JLP price history fetched.**

**38. MVRV / NUPL / on-chain valuation ratios.** Market value vs realised value as a
cycle-position gauge. **Gap: no on-chain cost-basis data.**

## Microstructure

**39. Order-book imbalance.** `(bid_vol - ask_vol)/(bid_vol + ask_vol)` at depth *k*. The
highest-frequency edge available. **Gap: no L2 data.**

**40. Trade-flow imbalance / aggressor ratio.** Signed trade prints. Requires tick data.
**Gap: no trade prints.** Note that Kyle/Glosten-Milgrom adverse-selection dynamics mean naïve
flow-following is systematically picked off.

**41. Avellaneda-Stoikov market making.** Optimal quotes around a reservation price with
inventory penalty. **Gap: needs L2 + a venue with maker rebates; also fundamentally an
execution strategy, not a directional signal, so this harness is the wrong shape for it.**

## Sentiment & alt-data

**42. Social/dev-activity sentiment.** Corpus documents social-sentiment alpha horizons of
**1–2 days with fast decay**, and bot-noise/sarcasm as principal difficulties. **Gap: no feed.**

## Cross-cutting: how to backtest any of these honestly

Distilled from the corpus's pitfall taxonomy, in the order these actually bite:

1. **Look-ahead, four mechanisms.** (1) *Data leakage* — full-sample normalisation is the
   classic; use expanding/rolling windows. (2) *Point-in-time failure* — restated data at
   historical dates. (3) *Survivorship* — 1.5–2.0% annual inflation in long-only equity
   backtests. (4) *Label leakage* — the label spans future bars; needs purge/embargo.
2. **Purged, embargoed CV.** Purge training observations whose label windows overlap the test
   fold; embargo the first *h* observations after it. **CPCV** samples all valid train/test
   combinations to give a *distribution* of backtest paths — the fix for the single-split
   problem that dominates every result in this document.
3. **Multiple testing.** 907 configurations were evaluated here. Harvey-Liu-Zhu: raise the
   t-stat bar from 2.0 to **3.0+**. Bailey et al.: PBO rises with the size of the search.
   Deflated Sharpe adjusts for trial count, skew, and kurtosis. McLean & Pontiff: **26%
   in-sample / 58% out-of-sample** decay across 97 published factors.
4. **Signal quality before strategy performance.** Information Coefficient (rank correlation of
   prediction with realised return) is the cleaner primitive: useful equity signals run
   **IC 0.02–0.08**, and **ICIR = mean(IC)/std(IC) > 0.5** is considered usable.
   Grinold-Kahn: `IR = IC * sqrt(Breadth)` — which is why single-asset strategies are
   structurally disadvantaged regardless of signal quality.
5. **Cost realism.** Costs on the fill, never netted at the end. Slippage as flat bps
   understates crash conditions. For leveraged SOL, the Jupiter borrow fee dominates: a
   measured 10× run burned **\$722 of borrow fees against \$211 of trading fees**.
6. **Sample-size floors.** Both trade count (10 minimum here, and 30+ would be better) and
   window length. Seventeen of twenty-five long-horizon singles failed the floor — that is a
   statement about the data, not the strategies.
